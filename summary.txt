**The Impact of Climate Change on Coastal Communities** Climate change is a pressing global issue with far-reaching consequences. In some cases, entire communities may be forced to relocate due to the relentless erosion of their coastline. Storm surges, which are caused by strong winds and low atmospheric pressure, can push seawater inland, leading to widespread flooding. Saltwater intrusion is another serious problem faced by coastal communities. As sea levels rise, saltwater can seep into freshwater aquifers, contaminating them with harmful minerals. Businesses may suffer losses, and jobs may be lost.
